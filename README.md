# Kyphosis Dataset Analysis

**Project Overview** 

This project focuses on analyzing the Kyphosis dataset obtained from Kaggle ( https://www.kaggle.com/abbasit/kyphosis-dataset ). The dataset was cleaned and used to train three machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. The objective was to predict the presence of kyphosis based on various features and compare the performance of the models.

**Dataset**

The Kyphosis dataset contains information on patients who underwent spinal surgery. Key attributes in the dataset include:

1. Kyphosis: Indicates whether kyphosis is present after the operation (Yes/No).

2. Age: Age of the patient (in months).

3.Number: The number of vertebrae involved in the operation.

4. Start: The number of the first (topmost) vertebra operated on.

# Data Cleaning:

1.Handled missing values and ensured the data was in the correct format for model training.

2.Checked for outliers and inconsistencies.

3.Visualized relationships between features.

4.Analyzed the distribution of the target variable (Kyphosis).

# Model Training and Evaluation:

Three models were trained using the cleaned dataset:

# Observations:

1.Logistic Regression performed the best with an accuracy of 84%.

2.Random Forest achieved a decent accuracy of 80%, benefiting from its ensemble approach.

4.The Decision Tree model underperformed with an accuracy of 64%, likely due to overfitting.
